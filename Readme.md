# Tools and Libraries

This is a personal list of tools and libraries I've used, thoughts about them, and any other info I feel may one day prove useful to myself.

## Web frameworks

    Django (Python)

    Great documentation, growing community, easy to hack on, good tutorial.

    https://www.djangoproject.com/


    Node.js (Javascript)

    Interesting model, some sharing of code between web server and web client which can be handy.

    http://nodejs.org/



## Client side

jQuery (DOM manipulation, AJAX, and events)

Massively extensible, massively helpful, great documentation. Can be a bit low-level for some larger projects, encouraging some spaghetti.

http://jquery.com/


jQueryUI

Technically a plugin for jQuery (I think), provides some nice widgets and some helpful stuff for implementing interactive pages.

http://jqueryui.com/


LESS (CSS templating)

CSS is a pain in the butt, only marginally less so with templating.

http://lesscss.org/


Backbone.js

Pseudo-MVC framework for client Javascript.

Tutorial: http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/


Handlebars.js

Minimal Javascript templating.

http://www.handlebarsjs.com/


Paper.js

Haven't really used it beyond a toy or two, but scriptable JS vector graphics library.

http://paperjs.org/


Gridless

Deserves a look, mobile-focused HTML5 boilerplate.

Guiders.js

jQuery plugin for doing user introductions e.g.
